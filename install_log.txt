I/flutter (31724): [IMPORTANT:flutter/shell/platform/android/android_context_vk_impeller.cc(62)] Using the Impeller rendering backend (Vulkan).
I/flutter (31724): Flutter Error: Zone mismatch.
I/flutter (31724): The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
I/flutter (31724): It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
I/flutter (31724): To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).
