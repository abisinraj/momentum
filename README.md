# Momentum

Welcome to Momentum, your personal fitness companion designed to work with you, not against you.

## What Makes Momentum Different

Unlike traditional fitness apps that tie you to rigid calendar schedules, Momentum understands that life happens. We use a cycle-based approach to track your workouts, letting you progress at your own pace without the guilt of missed days or broken streaks.

## Features

**Cycle-Based Workouts** - Your fitness journey moves forward with each workout, not each calendar day. Take a day off when you need it, and pick up right where you left off.

**Works Offline First** - Built with a local SQLite database using Drift, so your workout data is always available, even without an internet connection.

**Beautiful Interface** - Enjoy a clean, modern experience with Material 3 theming that feels right at home on your device.

**Quick Access Widget** - Stay motivated with an Android home screen widget that keeps your progress visible.

## Getting Started

Running Momentum is straightforward:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome  # For web
flutter run -d android # For Android
```

## Built For Real People

Momentum was created with the understanding that consistency doesn't mean perfection. Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or you're a seasoned athlete, Momentum adapts to your life and helps you build sustainable habits.

We hope Momentum helps you achieve your fitness goals, one workout at a time.
