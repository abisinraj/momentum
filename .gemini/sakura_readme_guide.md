## How the Animations Work

The SVG files use **CSS animations** that work on GitHub:
- ✅ Petals continuously fall downward
- ✅ Petals rotate as they fall
- ✅ Different speeds create natural movement
- ✅ Animations loop infinitely
- ✅ Works in GitHub README (SVG animations are supported!)

## Color Palette

All graphics use your app's pink/sakura theme:
- `#FFB7D5` - Light pink (main petals)
- `#FFC0CB` - Pink (secondary petals)
- `#FFD700` - Gold (flower centers)
- `#8B4513` - Brown (branches)
- `#FFF0F5` - Lavender blush (backgrounds)
- `#FFE5EC` - Light pink (gradients)

## To Use This README

### Option 1: Replace Current README
```bash
mv README.md README_OLD.md
mv README_SAKURA.md README.md
```

### Option 2: Keep Both
Just push both files to GitHub and link to the sakura version in your main README.

## Preview

The README will show:
1. **Top**: Animated header with falling petals and "MOMENTUM" title
2. **Throughout**: Sakura branches and petal decorations
3. **Sections**: Divided by sakura dividers
4. **Bottom**: Footer with branches and scattered petals

## Notes

- All animations are **pure SVG** - no JavaScript needed
- Works perfectly on GitHub
- Also works locally when viewing the markdown
- The "falling petals as you scroll" effect is achieved through the multiple animated SVG elements placed throughout the document

## Next Steps

1. Review `README_SAKURA.md`
2. Check the SVG files in `assets/images/`
3. If you like it, replace your current README
4. Push to GitHub to see the animations in action!

The sakura theme perfectly matches your app's philosophy of "blooming in your own time" 🌸
